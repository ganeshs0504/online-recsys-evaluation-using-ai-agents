Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.

RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting "Back to the Future" and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," both of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the other recommendations like "James and the Giant Peach" did not align with my taste, which made me less satisfied overall. Given my occasional viewing habits and niche preferences, the system partially met my expectations but didn't fully cater to my specific tastes.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.

RATING: 3
REASON: As someone with low openness and extraversion, I am not easily swayed by movies outside my comfort zone or popular picks. The system did not introduce any new or unexpected movies that piqued my interest enough to watch them. While it did recommend a couple of movies I liked, it didn't surprise me with any new, intriguing options that deviated from my usual preferences.
