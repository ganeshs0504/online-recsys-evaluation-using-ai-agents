Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As an occasional viewer with a specific taste for drama, I found that the recommender system did not align well with my preferences. Out of the five movies recommended, only "Shakespeare in Love" matched my taste, and I rated it a 4. The rest of the recommendations were not appealing to me, which led to a somewhat unsatisfactory experience. Given that I only found one movie that I liked, I decided to leave the system after just one page of recommendations.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. As a niche explorer, I am open to exploring different genres if the film sounds interesting. However, the recommendations I received were mostly animated or family-oriented films, which do not align with my usual preference for drama. While I appreciate the inclusion of "Shakespeare in Love," the overall selection did not entice me to watch movies outside my preferred genre.
