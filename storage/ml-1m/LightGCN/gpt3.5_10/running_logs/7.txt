        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Annie Hall (1977), Amadeus (1984), Godfather: Part II, The (1974), Chinatown (1974), Citizen Kane (1941), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall (1977)', 'Chinatown (1974)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system provided some classic and critically acclaimed movie recommendations that align with my taste, which I appreciate. However, it also suggested movies that I clearly dislike, such as "Annie Hall" and "Chinatown," which left me feeling unsatisfied overall.

Q2: RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. While it did recommend some quality films, the fact that it also suggested movies that I dislike shows that it didn't fully understand my preferences as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. This lack of personalization made me less inclined to watch the recommended movies, even if they were well-regarded by others.
