        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Shawshank Redemption, The, Saving Private Ryan, English Patient, The, Forrest Gump, Titanic, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['English Patient, The', 'Titanic'].

        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q1: RATING: 7; REASON: I feel moderately satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, such as "Shawshank Redemption" and "Saving Private Ryan," I was disappointed with the inclusion of "English Patient, The" and "Titanic," which I disliked. Overall, the system did a decent job, but there is room for improvement in better understanding my preferences.

Q2: RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system mildly surprised me with its recommendations. Although I appreciate the effort in suggesting a variety of movies, including ones that may not align perfectly with my tastes, such as "English Patient, The" and "Titanic," I am still hesitant to watch them due to my highly selective nature. The system's attempt to introduce some diversity is noted, but it didn't significantly sway my viewing decisions.
