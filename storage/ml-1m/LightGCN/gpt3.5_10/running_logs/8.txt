It did a good job of recommending movies that align with my preferences for dramatic and emotional storylines, thought-provoking films, and a mix of humor and romance. The system accurately captured my taste and provided relevant suggestions. However, there is always room for improvement, hence the rating of 8.

Q2: RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system positively surprised me to some extent.
