        Relevant context from user 5's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: GoodFellas (1990), Pulp Fiction (1994), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella) (1997), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['GoodFellas (1990)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 5, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Pulp Fiction" and "Shawshank Redemption," which I enjoyed. However, the fact that it also suggested "GoodFellas," which I disliked, made me feel unsatisfied overall. Additionally, the system didn't offer enough variety in its recommendations to truly impress me.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. While it did recommend some movies I liked, the lack of variety and the inclusion of a movie I disliked made me less inclined to explore further recommendations. The system failed to capture my interest enough to consider watching movies outside of my usual preferences.
