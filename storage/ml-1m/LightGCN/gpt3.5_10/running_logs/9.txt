        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q1: RATING: 7; REASON: I feel moderately satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, there were still some misses like "Godfather, The" which I didn't like at all. However, the system did a decent job overall in suggesting movies that aligned with my preferences.

Q2: RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system mildly surprised me with its suggestions. Although I typically stick to my preferred genres, the system did manage to recommend a couple of movies that I wouldn't have chosen myself but ended up enjoying, like "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." This slight positive surprise makes me slightly more open to exploring recommendations that may not align with my usual taste in the future.
