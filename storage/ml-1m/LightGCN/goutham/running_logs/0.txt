**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 4

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, and my tastes are very specific. The recommender system did suggest "Toy Story 2," which I enjoyed and rated a 4. However, the rest of the recommendations like "Babe" and "Shakespeare in Love" did not align with my preferences for clever humor. Given my selective nature, the system only partially met my expectations, leading to a low satisfaction rating.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 2

**REASON:** As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am very particular about the movies I choose to watch. The recommender system did not positively surprise me much because the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste for clever humor. While "Toy Story 2" was a good match, the rest were not compelling enough to make me consider watching them. Therefore, the system did little to entice me beyond my usual preferences.
