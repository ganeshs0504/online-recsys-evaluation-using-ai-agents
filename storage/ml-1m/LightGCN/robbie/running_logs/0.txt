Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As a Movie Enthusiast, I was excited to dive into the recommendations, but the system fell short of my expectations. The movies recommended on page 1, such as 'Toy Story 2', 'Babe', 'Aladdin', 'Shakespeare in Love', and 'The Lion King', did not align with my taste for thought-provoking science fiction films. While these are popular and well-loved movies, they didn't cater to my specific interests. I appreciate the effort, but the recommendations felt too mainstream and not tailored to my unique preferences as a Cinematic Trailblazer.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me. As someone who seeks out unique and obscure films, I was hoping for recommendations that would introduce me to new and thought-provoking science fiction movies. Instead, the system suggested well-known and widely appreciated films that I had already decided were not to my liking. There was no element of surprise or discovery, which is something I highly value in a recommendation system.
