        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Annie Hall, Amadeus, Godfather: Part II, The, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, among them, I watched ['Godfather: Part II, The'] and rate them ['5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: While the system did recommend "The Godfather: Part II," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations did not align with my incredibly selective taste. I found "Annie Hall" particularly unappealing. Given my discerning nature and the fact that I seldom watch movies, the system failed to provide a list that fully captivated my interest. Therefore, my satisfaction is quite low.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am rarely swayed by recommendations that fall outside my meticulously curated preferences. While the inclusion of "The Godfather: Part II" was a hit, the rest of the recommendations did not pique my interest at all. The system did not introduce me to any new films that I would consider watching, thus failing to positively surprise me.
