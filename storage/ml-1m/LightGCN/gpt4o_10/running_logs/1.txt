        Relevant context from user 1's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), Saving Private Ryan (1998), English Patient, The (1996), Forrest Gump (1994), Titanic (1997), among them, I watched ['Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)', 'Saving Private Ryan (1998)', 'Forrest Gump (1994)'] and rate them ['5', '4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
        Act as user 1, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 7; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job of suggesting movies that align with my tastes, particularly with "Shawshank Redemption," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Forrest Gump," all of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the inclusion of "The English Patient" and "Titanic" did not resonate with me as much. While these are critically acclaimed films, they don't align as closely with my preferences. Overall, the system was satisfactory but could benefit from more precise tailoring to my specific tastes.

Q2: RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not particularly surprise me with its suggestions. The movies recommended were mostly well-known and popular, which I had already seen or had a clear opinion about. There was little in the way of unexpected or novel recommendations that might have intrigued me to step outside my usual preferences. While the quality of the recommended movies was generally high, the lack of surprising or diverse options left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed.
