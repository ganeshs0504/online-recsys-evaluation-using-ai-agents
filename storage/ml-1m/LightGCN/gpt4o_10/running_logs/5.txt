Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: While the recommender system did suggest two movies that I thoroughly enjoyed and rated highly ('GoodFellas' and 'Pulp Fiction'), the rest of the recommendations did not align with my tastes. Given my incredibly selective viewing habits, the system's inability to consistently match my preferences left me somewhat unsatisfied. However, the two successful recommendations do show that the system has potential.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am rarely swayed by recommendations that do not align with my established tastes. The system did not introduce any new movies that intrigued me enough to deviate from my preferences. While the quality of the recommended movies was high, they did not positively surprise me or compel me to watch something outside my usual interests.
