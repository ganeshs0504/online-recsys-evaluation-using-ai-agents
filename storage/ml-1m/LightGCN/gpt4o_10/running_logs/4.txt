I dislike the rest movies: ['Gladiator (2000)', 'U-571 (2000)'].

        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gladiator (2000), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Peacemaker, The (1997), U-571 (2000), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), among them, I watched ['Lethal Weapon 3 (1992)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Gladiator (2000)', 'U-571 (2000)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

- **RATING:** 4
- **REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and high expectations when it comes to movie recommendations. While I did enjoy "Lethal Weapon 3" and rated it a 4, the rest of the recommendations did not align with my preferences. Movies like "Gladiator" and "U-571" are not in my preferred genres, which made the overall experience less satisfying. Given my selective nature, I was hoping for more tailored suggestions that fit my taste for action-packed movies, comedies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

- **RATING:** 3
- **REASON:** The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am very particular about the movies I choose to watch. The system recommended several movies that did not align with my tastes, and none of them intrigued me enough to consider watching them despite my usual preferences. The only movie that matched my taste was "Lethal Weapon 3," which I had already seen. Therefore, the system did not provide any new or unexpected recommendations that would entice me to watch something outside my usual genres.
