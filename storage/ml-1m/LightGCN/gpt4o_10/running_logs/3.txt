Relevant context from your memory:
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, Edward Scissorhands, Dave, Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day', 'Pretty Woman'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Dave'].

        Relevant context from user 3's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, Edward Scissorhands, Dave, Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day', 'Pretty Woman'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Dave'].

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 5

**REASON:** As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, it's rare for me to be drawn to movie recommendations. The system did recommend two movies I enjoyed, "Groundhog Day" and "Pretty Woman," which I rated both as 4. However, the rest of the recommendations didn't align with my tastes, and I even disliked "Dave." Given my niche preferences and the fact that I left after just one page, the system was only moderately successful in capturing my interest.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 4

**REASON:** As a Maverick Critic and Niche Explorer, I tend to have very specific tastes and am not easily swayed by recommendations that don't align with them. While the system did recommend a couple of movies I enjoyed, it didn't introduce me to anything outside my usual preferences that I found intriguing. The overall quality of the recommendations was decent, but it didn't offer any surprising or compelling choices that would make me reconsider my usual viewing habits.
