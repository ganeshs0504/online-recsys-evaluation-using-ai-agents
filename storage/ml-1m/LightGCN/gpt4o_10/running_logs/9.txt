Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: While the system did recommend "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations didn't align with my tastes. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I need recommendations that are spot-on to keep me engaged. The other movies suggested were either too mainstream or didn't pique my interest, leading me to leave the system after just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The system didn't really surprise me positively. While "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" was a great recommendation, it was already within my known preferences. The other movies were too predictable and didn't offer anything new or intriguing that would make me step out of my usual viewing habits. As a maverick critic and niche explorer, I was hoping for more unique and thought-provoking suggestions that could catch my elusive interest.
