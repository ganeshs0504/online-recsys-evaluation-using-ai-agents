Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.

RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did suggest "Aladdin (1992)," which aligns perfectly with my taste for animated movies with a touch of adventure and fantasy. However, the other recommendations like "Shakespeare in Love (1998)" and "Groundhog Day (1993)" did not match my preferences at all. Given my incredibly selective viewing habits, the system only partially met my expectations.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.

RATING: 3; REASON: As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am very particular about the movies I choose to watch. The system did not positively surprise me much because the majority of the recommendations did not align with my very specific tastes. While "Aladdin (1992)" was a good match, the rest were not compelling enough to make me consider watching them, thus limiting the element of positive surprise.
