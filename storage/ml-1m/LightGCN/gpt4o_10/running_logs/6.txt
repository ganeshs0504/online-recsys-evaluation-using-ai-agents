**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 6

**REASON:** The recommender system had a mixed success rate for me. While it did suggest "Chinatown" and "All About Eve," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated highly, it also recommended movies like "Annie Hall" and "Singin' in the Rain," which didn't align with my tastes at all. As an occasional viewer with a specific taste for thrilling, emotionally charged, and thought-provoking films, I found the system to be somewhat hit-or-miss. Therefore, I am moderately satisfied but see room for improvement in tailoring recommendations more closely to my unique preferences.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 4

**REASON:** The recommender system didn't particularly surprise me in a positive way. While it did suggest a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the rest of the recommendations were not appealing to me. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I am always on the lookout for unique and obscure films, but the system's suggestions didn't venture into that territory. The recommendations felt somewhat conventional and didn't inspire me to explore beyond my usual tastes. Therefore, the system didn't significantly motivate me to watch movies outside my personal preferences.
