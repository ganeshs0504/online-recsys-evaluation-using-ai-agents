        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects, Fargo, Good Will Hunting, among them, I watched ['The Shawshank Redemption'] and rate them ['5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Fargo'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I am very selective about the movies I choose to watch. While the system did recommend "The Shawshank Redemption," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations like "Fargo" did not align with my tastes. Given my high standards and infrequent movie-watching habits, I found the overall experience somewhat unsatisfactory, leading me to exit the system after just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The system did not positively surprise me much. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have very specific tastes, and the recommendations did not offer much that intrigued me beyond "The Shawshank Redemption." The other movies recommended did not align with my preferences for dramatic, emotional, thought-provoking, or unconventional storylines, nor did they offer a mix of humor and romance or action and adventure that I enjoy. Therefore, the system did little to entice me to watch movies outside my usual taste.
