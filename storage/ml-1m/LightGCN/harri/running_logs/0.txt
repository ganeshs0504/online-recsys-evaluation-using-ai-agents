Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting some movies that I enjoyed, like "Babe (1995)" and "Groundhog Day (1993)," which I rated highly. However, it also recommended movies like "Toy Story 2 (1999)" and "Lion King, The (1994)" that didn't align with my taste. While I appreciate the effort, the system needs to better understand my preferences for emotionally deep and inspirational films, classic movies, and heartwarming stories about human connections.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: The recommender system didn't really surprise me positively. While it did suggest a few movies that I enjoyed, most of the recommendations were either too mainstream or didn't align with my niche interests. I am more inclined to watch movies that have rich character development and emotionally deep narratives, and the system didn't quite capture that aspect of my taste.
