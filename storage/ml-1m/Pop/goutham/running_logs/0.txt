This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I am very selective about the movies I choose to watch. The recommender system suggested five movies, out of which only one, "Caddyshack," appealed to my taste for clever humor. The rest of the recommendations did not align with my preferences, leading to a rather unsatisfactory experience. Given my high standards and infrequent movie-watching habits, I expected more tailored suggestions.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 2
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have a very narrow range of movie preferences. The system's suggestions, apart from "Caddyshack," did not entice me to step out of my comfort zone. The overall quality of the recommendations did not impress me enough to consider watching movies that did not align with my personal taste.
