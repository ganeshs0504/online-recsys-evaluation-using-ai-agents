**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 7

**REASON:** The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that I found enjoyable. I particularly liked "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Body Heat," which I rated highly. However, I was not as impressed with "Runaway Bride" and disliked "Caddyshack" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?". While the system did manage to recommend a couple of films that matched my taste, it also suggested some that were not to my liking. Overall, it was a mixed experience, but I appreciate the effort and the variety offered.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 6

**REASON:** The recommender system did manage to surprise me with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Body Heat," which were outside my usual preference but turned out to be enjoyable. However, the inclusion of movies like "Caddyshack" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" didn't align with my taste and were not appealing to me. While I appreciate the system's attempt to introduce me to a broader range of films, the success rate was moderate. The positive surprises were there, but they were balanced out by some less favorable recommendations.
