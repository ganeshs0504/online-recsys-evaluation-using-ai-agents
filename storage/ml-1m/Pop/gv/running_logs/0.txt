Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting 'Any Given Sunday' and 'Fistful of Dollars, A,' both of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the rest of the recommendations like 'Caddyshack,' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' did not align with my taste. As an occasional viewer, I prefer recommendations that closely match my interests, and having half of the suggestions miss the mark was somewhat disappointing. 

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 5
- REASON: While the system did manage to recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, it didn't particularly surprise me with any out-of-the-box suggestions that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. The recommendations that I disliked were not intriguing enough to make me want to explore beyond my usual preferences. Therefore, while it did a fair job, it didn't offer any standout surprises that would make me more inclined to watch movies outside my typical taste.
