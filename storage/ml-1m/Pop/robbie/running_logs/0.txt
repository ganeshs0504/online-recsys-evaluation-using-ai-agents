Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 7
- REASON: The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting "Seven (Se7en)" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," both of which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated highly. However, the other recommendations like "Caddyshack," "Any Given Sunday," and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" were not to my taste at all. As a Movie Enthusiast, I appreciate the effort, but as a Maverick Critic and Cinematic Trailblazer, I expect more avant-garde and thought-provoking science fiction films. There's room for improvement in aligning the recommendations more closely with my unique preferences.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: While the system did manage to surprise me with "Seven (Se7en)" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," which I found to be excellent choices, the other recommendations fell flat. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I am always on the lookout for unique and obscure films, and the system didn't quite hit the mark in that regard. The positive surprise came from the quality of the two films I enjoyed, but the overall selection could have been more diverse and aligned with my avant-garde tastes.
