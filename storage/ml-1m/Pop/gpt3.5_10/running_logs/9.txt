        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Postino, Il (The Postman), Muppet Movie, The, Hoosiers, Toy Story 2, Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension, The, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Postino, Il (The Postman)', 'Muppet Movie, The', 'Hoosiers', 'Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension, The'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

As user 9, here are my responses to the interview questions:

Q1: RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While it did suggest a variety of movies, most of them did not align with my preferences. I only watched one movie from the recommendations, and the rest were not to my liking. I wish the system could better understand my unique taste and suggest more suitable options.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. The recommended movies were quite far from my usual preferences, and I did not feel motivated to watch them based on the suggestions provided. I prefer recommendations that align more closely with my specific interests and tastes.
