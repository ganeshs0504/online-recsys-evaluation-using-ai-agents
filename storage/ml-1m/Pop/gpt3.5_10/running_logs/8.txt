        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Seven (Se7en), Me, Myself and Irene, Ladyhawke, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Dog Day Afternoon, among them, I watched ['Seven (Se7en)', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste.

Q1: RATING: 7; REASON: I feel moderately satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, there were still a few that didn't match my taste at all. However, I appreciate the effort in providing a mix of options.

Q2: RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did surprise me slightly with its choices, especially with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," which I ended up enjoying despite not being a typical genre I go for. However, I still prefer movies that align more closely with my usual preferences, so the positive surprise wasn't strong enough to significantly impact my viewing habits.
