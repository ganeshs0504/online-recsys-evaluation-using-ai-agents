        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

As user 5:

Q1: RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While it did provide me with some movie recommendations, I found that most of the suggestions did not align with my taste in movies. Additionally, the system failed to accurately predict my preferences, leading to a lackluster experience overall.

Q2: RATING: 1; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with highly selective tastes, I was not inclined to watch any of the recommended movies that deviated from my preferred genres and themes. The system's suggestions did not offer anything that piqued my interest or motivated me to explore new cinematic experiences.
