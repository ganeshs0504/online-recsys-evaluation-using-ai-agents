        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Titan A.E., Gladiator, Misery, Scent of a Woman, Patriot Games, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Titan A.E.', 'Gladiator', 'Scent of a Woman', 'Patriot Games'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite listing some movies I enjoyed, such as "Misery," it also recommended movies like "Titan A.E." and "Gladiator," which are not at all in line with my taste for action-packed and suspenseful thrillers. The system failed to accurately capture my preferences, leading to a disappointing experience overall.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. The movie choices presented to me did not align with my preferences for action-packed, comedy, and sports dramas. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have very specific tastes, and the system's recommendations did not demonstrate an understanding of that. This lack of personalization and relevance to my movie preferences greatly reduced my motivation to watch any of the recommended films.
