        Relevant context from user 0's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Clueless (1995), Caddyshack (1980), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Green Mile, The (1999), Grapes of Wrath, The (1940), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 0, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 1; REASON: I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommender system. None of the recommended movies aligned with my highly selective taste in movies. I found the suggestions to be completely off-base and not reflective of my preferences for animated movies, classic musicals, heartwarming dramas, family-friendly movies, or historical dramas.

Q2: RATING: 1; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with a strong preference for specific genres and themes, I have very little interest in deviating from my usual movie choices. The recommendations provided did not spark any curiosity or motivation for me to explore movies outside of my comfort zone.
