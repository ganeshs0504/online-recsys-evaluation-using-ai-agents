**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 3

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very high standards and specific tastes when it comes to movies. Out of the five recommendations, I only found one movie, "End of Days (1999)," that matched my preferences, and I rated it a 4. The rest of the recommendations did not align with my taste at all. Given my selective nature, this left me feeling quite unsatisfied with the overall experience. The system did not cater well to my discerning and exclusive movie-watching habits.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 2

**REASON:** The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. As someone who is exceedingly discerning and selective, I found that most of the recommendations did not align with my personal taste. While "End of Days (1999)" was a decent match, the rest of the movies were far from what I typically enjoy. The system failed to present options that could entice me to step out of my usual preferences, which is a rare occurrence for me. Therefore, the overall quality and choice of movies did not impress me or encourage me to watch something outside my usual scope.
