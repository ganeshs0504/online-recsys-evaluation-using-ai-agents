        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Postino, Il (The Postman), Scream 3, Magnolia, End of Days, Scrooged, among them, I watched ['Postino, Il (The Postman)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Scream 3', 'End of Days', 'Scrooged'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 5

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, my standards for movie recommendations are exceptionally high. The system did manage to recommend "Postino, Il (The Postman)," which I enjoyed and rated a 4. However, the rest of the recommendations like "Scream 3," "End of Days," and "Scrooged" did not align with my discerning taste for classic, thought-provoking, and critically acclaimed films. Given that I only found one movie out of five that matched my preferences, I can't say I'm fully satisfied. Hence, a middle-of-the-road rating of 5 seems appropriate.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 3

**REASON:** As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have very specific tastes, and the system's recommendations largely failed to meet them. While "Postino, Il (The Postman)" was a pleasant surprise, the other recommendations did not entice me at all. The system did not manage to positively surprise me enough to consider watching movies outside my usual preferences. Therefore, I would rate the positive surprise factor quite low at a 3.
