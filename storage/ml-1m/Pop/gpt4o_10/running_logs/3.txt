        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: X-Men (2000), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Bull Durham (1988), Fatal Attraction (1987), among them, I watched ['X-Men (2000)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)', 'Bull Durham (1988)', 'Fatal Attraction (1987)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be spot on. While I enjoyed "X-Men (2000)" and rated it a 4, the rest of the recommendations didn't appeal to me at all. "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)", "Bull Durham (1988)", and "Fatal Attraction (1987)" were not to my taste. Given my niche preferences, I was hoping for more horror, romantic comedies, or classic movies. The system didn't quite hit the mark for me.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As a maverick critic, I don't usually follow historical ratings and prefer to judge movies based on my own taste. The recommendations didn't surprise me positively because they didn't align with my preferred genres or pique my interest enough to step out of my comfort zone. While "X-Men (2000)" was a good pick, the rest didn't intrigue me, and I quickly lost interest. The system needs to better understand my niche preferences to positively surprise me.
