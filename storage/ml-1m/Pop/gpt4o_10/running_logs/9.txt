Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be spot on. Out of the five movies recommended, I only found one that I enjoyed, "Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension," which I rated a 4. The rest of the recommendations didn't align with my tastes at all. Given my infrequent movie-watching habits, I was hoping for more tailored suggestions that fit my niche preferences for action-packed, thought-provoking, and suspenseful films. The system didn't meet my expectations, leading to a low satisfaction rating.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 2
- REASON: The recommender system didn't positively surprise me much. While "Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension" was an interesting pick that I enjoyed, the rest of the recommendations were quite off the mark. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies based on my own taste and not historical ratings, and the system failed to present options that intrigued me enough to step out of my usual preferences. The overall quality of the recommendations was disappointing, leading to a low rating for positive surprise.
