**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING: 6**

**REASON:** The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting "Fantasia 2000" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," both of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the other recommendations like "Mr. Mom" and "U-571" did not align with my tastes at all. As an occasional viewer with a penchant for unique and thought-provoking films, I found the system somewhat hit-or-miss. While it did provide a couple of excellent suggestions, the overall experience was not consistently satisfying.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING: 5**

**REASON:** The recommender system did manage to surprise me positively with "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which I found to be an exceptional film. However, the other recommendations did not pique my interest or align with my taste for thrilling, emotionally charged, and thought-provoking movies. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I seek unique and obscure films, and the system fell short in offering a diverse range of such movies. While there was some positive surprise, it was not enough to make a significant impact.
