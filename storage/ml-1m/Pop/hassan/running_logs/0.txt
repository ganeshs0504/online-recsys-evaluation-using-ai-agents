Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As an occasional viewer with a specific taste for drama, I found that only one out of the five recommended movies, "Seven (Se7en)," aligned with my preferences. While I enjoyed "Seven (Se7en)" and rated it a 4, the rest of the recommendations did not match my interests at all. This mismatch led to a somewhat unsatisfactory experience, prompting me to leave the system after browsing just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. While I appreciate the inclusion of "Seven (Se7en)," which I enjoyed, the other recommendations were far from my preferred genre of drama. As a niche explorer, I am open to exploring different genres if the film sounds interesting, but none of the other recommendations piqued my interest. Therefore, the system did not significantly motivate me to watch movies outside my usual taste.
