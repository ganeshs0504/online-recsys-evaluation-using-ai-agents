Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting "Saving Private Ryan" and "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," both of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also recommended movies like "American Beauty" and "The Silence of the Lambs," which I disliked. Given my niche preferences, I would have preferred more recommendations that align closely with my taste in inspirational stories, action-packed adventures, and classic crime dramas. The mixed results led me to leave the system after just one page.

The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.

- REASON: While the system did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, it didn't particularly surprise me with any out-of-the-box suggestions that I wouldn't normally consider but ended up liking. The recommendations were somewhat predictable based on my historical ratings and preferences. I appreciate the effort, but I wasn't compelled to explore beyond my usual genres or tastes based on the recommendations provided.
