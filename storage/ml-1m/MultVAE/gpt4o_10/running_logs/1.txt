        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Forrest Gump (1994), Being John Malkovich (1999), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), As Good As It Gets (1997), among them, I watched ['Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)'] and rate them ['5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)', 'Forrest Gump (1994)', 'Being John Malkovich (1999)', 'As Good As It Gets (1997)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: The recommender system did suggest "The Shawshank Redemption," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5. However, the rest of the recommendations did not align with my very selective taste. Given that I am an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I found the majority of the recommendations to be unsatisfactory. This mismatch led me to leave the system after browsing just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: While I appreciate the inclusion of a highly rated movie like "The Shawshank Redemption," which I loved, the rest of the recommendations were not appealing to me. As someone who is highly selective and has a very specific taste in movies, the system did not positively surprise me enough to consider watching the other recommendations. The overall quality of the recommendations did not meet my expectations, leading to a low rating in this regard.
