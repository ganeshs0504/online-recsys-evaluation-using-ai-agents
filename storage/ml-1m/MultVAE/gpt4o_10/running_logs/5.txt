**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

- **RATING:** 6
- **REASON:** The recommender system did a decent job by suggesting "Saving Private Ryan" and "Pulp Fiction," both of which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also recommended movies like "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," which I didn't like. Given my incredibly selective viewing habits, the system's mixed results left me somewhat unsatisfied. I appreciate the effort, but the hit-to-miss ratio needs improvement for someone as discerning as I am.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

- **RATING:** 4
- **REASON:** As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am rarely swayed by recommendations that don't align with my personal taste. While the system did recommend some movies I enjoyed, it also suggested several that didn't appeal to me at all. The overall quality of the recommendations was somewhat predictable and didn't offer any pleasant surprises that would make me step out of my comfort zone. Therefore, the system didn't significantly positively surprise me.
