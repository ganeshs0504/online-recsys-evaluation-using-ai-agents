        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Back to the Future (1985), Sixth Sense, The (1999), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), among them, I watched ['Sixth Sense, The (1999)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 4

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, and it takes a lot to capture my interest. The recommender system did suggest "The Sixth Sense," which I enjoyed and rated a 4. However, the rest of the recommendations didn't align with my unique taste. I appreciate thought-provoking and suspenseful films, but the other suggestions like "Star Wars" and "Back to the Future" didn't appeal to me. Therefore, while the system had a hit, it also had several misses, leading to a lower satisfaction rating.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 3

**REASON:** The recommender system didn't particularly surprise me in a positive way. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies based on my own taste, and the system's recommendations largely fell outside my preferred genres and styles. While "The Sixth Sense" was a good recommendation, the rest didn't intrigue me enough to consider watching them. The system's overall quality didn't impress me, as it didn't cater well to my niche preferences and unique tastes.
