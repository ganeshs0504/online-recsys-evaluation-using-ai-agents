        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Annie Hall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Serpico, Amadeus, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, among them, I watched ["One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"] and rate them ['5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall', 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: While the recommender system did suggest "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations did not align with my tastes. Given my incredibly selective viewing habits, the system failed to provide a broader selection of movies that match my specific preferences for classic, thought-provoking dramas, and well-crafted films. This left me somewhat unsatisfied, leading to my decision to exit the system after just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: The system did not positively surprise me much. Given my exceedingly discerning and selective viewing habits, I found that most of the recommendations did not appeal to my specific tastes. Although "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" was a hit, the rest of the suggestions like "Annie Hall" and "Dr. Strangelove" did not resonate with me. The overall quality of the recommendations did not compel me to consider movies outside my usual preferences.
