        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: English Patient, The (1996), Shakespeare in Love (1998), Being John Malkovich (1999), Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella) (1997), Schindler's List (1993), among them, I watched ['Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella) (1997)'] and rate them ['5'] respectively.

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: While the recommender system did suggest "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella)" which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations did not align with my incredibly selective and discerning taste. Given my infrequent movie-watching habits, I expect recommendations to be almost perfectly tailored to my preferences. The fact that only one out of five movies resonated with me left me somewhat unsatisfied, leading me to exit the system after just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have very high standards for the movies I choose to watch. The recommender system did not positively surprise me much because the majority of the recommendations did not align with my specific tastes. While "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella)" was an excellent recommendation, the other movies did not pique my interest enough to consider watching them, reflecting a lack of alignment with my highly curated preferences.
