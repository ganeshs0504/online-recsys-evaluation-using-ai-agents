        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Twister (1996), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), Negotiator, The (1998), Independence Day (ID4) (1996), Lost in Space (1998), among them, I watched ['Lethal Weapon 3 (1992)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Twister (1996)', 'Lost in Space (1998)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

- **RATING:** 4
- **REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, my expectations are quite high when it comes to movie recommendations. While the system did manage to recommend "Lethal Weapon 3," which I enjoyed and rated a 4, the rest of the recommendations like "Twister" and "Lost in Space" did not align with my tastes. Given my selective nature, the system's inability to consistently recommend movies that match my preferences left me somewhat unsatisfied. Therefore, I decided to leave after browsing just one page.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

- **RATING:** 3
- **REASON:** The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have very specific tastes, and the system only managed to hit the mark with one movie out of five. The other recommendations did not entice me to step out of my comfort zone or explore new genres. The overall quality of the recommendations did not impress me enough to consider watching movies that do not align with my personal taste.
