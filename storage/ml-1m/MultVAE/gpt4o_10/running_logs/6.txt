**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 7

**REASON:** The recommender system did a decent job of suggesting movies that align with my taste, particularly in the realm of timeless classics and emotionally resonant films. I thoroughly enjoyed "Cabaret (1972)," "All About Eve (1950)," and "Maltese Falcon, The (1941)," giving them high ratings. However, I was not impressed with "Annie Hall (1977)" and "Singin' in the Rain (1952)," which didn't resonate with me. While the system did recommend some excellent films, the inclusion of movies that I disliked slightly dampened my overall satisfaction.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 6

**REASON:** As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I am always on the lookout for unique and obscure films. While the recommender system did suggest some classics that I enjoyed, it didn't introduce me to any particularly avant-garde or thought-provoking films that I hadn't already considered. The system did a fair job, but it didn't significantly surprise me or push the boundaries of my usual taste. I appreciate the effort, but I was hoping for more diverse and intellectually stimulating recommendations.
