Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I found the recommendations largely unappealing. Out of the five movies suggested, I only watched "Pulp Fiction," which I rated a 4. The rest of the movies did not align with my very selective taste for clever humor. Given that I am highly selective and the system only managed to recommend one movie that I found somewhat enjoyable, my satisfaction is quite low.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 2
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am very particular about the movies I choose to watch. The system recommended several movies that did not match my taste for clever humor. While "Pulp Fiction" was a decent recommendation, the rest were not appealing at all. Therefore, my inclination to watch the recommended movies that didn't align with my taste was extremely low.
