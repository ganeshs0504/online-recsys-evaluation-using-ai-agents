        Relevant context from user 5's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Pulp Fiction (1994), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Godfather, The (1972), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Godfather, The (1972)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 5, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

As user 5, here are my responses to the interview questions:

Q1: RATING: 6; REASON: I feel somewhat satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Pulp Fiction," there were also movies like "The Godfather" that I disliked. The system could improve by better understanding my specific tastes and not recommending movies that are clearly outside of my preferences.

Q2: RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. While it did suggest some movies I enjoyed, the inclusion of "The Godfather," which I disliked, was a significant drawback. The system's inability to accurately predict my preferences based on my previous interactions was disappointing and did not motivate me to explore further recommendations.
