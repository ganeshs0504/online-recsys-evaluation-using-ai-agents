- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Back to the Future, Sixth Sense, The, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back', 'Sixth Sense, The', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'] and rate them ['4', '5', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Back to the Future'].

        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Back to the Future, Sixth Sense, The, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back', 'Sixth Sense, The', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'] and rate them ['4', '5', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Back to the Future'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 6; REASON: I feel somewhat satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend a few movies that I enjoyed, such as "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," there were also some misses like "Back to the Future" that I didn't like at all. Overall, it provided a mix of recommendations that partially aligned with my tastes.

Q2: RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system didn't positively surprise me much. I appreciate that it suggested some action-packed and intense movies that I enjoy, but there weren't enough thought-provoking or satirical films that I prefer. Additionally, the system didn't offer enough variety outside of the mainstream recommendations, which limited my interest in exploring further.
