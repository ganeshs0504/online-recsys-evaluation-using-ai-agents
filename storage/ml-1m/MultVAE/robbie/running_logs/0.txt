Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: While the recommender system did suggest "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," which I absolutely loved and rated a 5, the rest of the recommendations didn't align with my taste. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I'm always on the lookout for unique and thought-provoking films, especially in the science fiction genre. Movies like "Saving Private Ryan," "American Beauty," "Silence of the Lambs," and "Pulp Fiction" are undoubtedly classics, but they didn't resonate with my specific preferences. Therefore, while the system did hit one high note, it missed the mark on the majority of its suggestions.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: The recommender system didn't really surprise me in a positive way. Most of the movies suggested were well-known and mainstream, which doesn't cater to my desire for diverse and avant-garde films. While I appreciate the quality of the movies recommended, they didn't offer the unique and obscure choices I crave. The one exception was "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," which I enjoyed immensely, but it wasn't enough to significantly elevate my overall impression of the system's ability to surprise me with its recommendations.
