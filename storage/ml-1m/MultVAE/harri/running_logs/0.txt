Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 9
- REASON: The recommender system did an excellent job of suggesting movies that align with my tastes. I thoroughly enjoyed all the movies recommended on page 1, giving high ratings to each. The system clearly understands my preference for films with emotional depth, romance, and classic appeal. The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is that I'm always on the lookout for that extra element of surprise or a hidden gem that I might not have discovered on my own.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 7
- REASON: While the recommender system did a fantastic job of aligning with my tastes, it didn't venture too far out of my comfort zone. I appreciate the quality of the recommendations, but I would have liked to see a few more unexpected choices that might have broadened my horizons. The movies suggested were all within genres and themes I already enjoy, so there wasn't much of a surprise factor. However, the overall quality and relevance of the recommendations were high, which is why I still rate it positively.
