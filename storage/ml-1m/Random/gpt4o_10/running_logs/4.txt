        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Village of the Damned (1995), Gnome-Mobile, The (1967), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), Loser (2000), Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1997), among them, I watched ['Assault on Precinct 13 (1976)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Village of the Damned (1995)', 'Gnome-Mobile, The (1967)', 'Loser (2000)', "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1997)"].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be spot-on. Out of the five movies recommended, only one—"Assault on Precinct 13 (1976)"—matched my taste, and I rated it a 4. The rest of the recommendations were far from my preferences, which include action-packed movies, comedies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas. Given my exceedingly discerning and selective nature, the system failed to provide a satisfactory selection, leading me to leave after just one page.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 2
- REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have very specific tastes, and the system's recommendations largely missed the mark. The only movie I watched and rated was "Assault on Precinct 13 (1976)," which did align with my preferences. However, the other recommendations were not appealing at all, and I found no motivation to watch them. The overall quality of the recommendations did not impress me, and I quickly exited the system due to dissatisfaction.
