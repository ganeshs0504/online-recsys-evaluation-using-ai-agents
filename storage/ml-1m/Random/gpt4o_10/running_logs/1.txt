Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 6
- REASON: The recommender system did manage to suggest a couple of movies that I thoroughly enjoyed, such as "A Chef in Love (1996)" and "Guns of Navarone, The (1961)," which I rated 4 and 5 respectively. However, the other recommendations like "Grumpier Old Men (1995)" and "Sugar Town (1999)" did not align with my tastes at all. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a higher degree of accuracy in recommendations. The system showed some promise but needs improvement in curating suggestions that match my specific preferences more consistently.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined you are to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with your personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 4
- REASON: As someone who is highly selective and meticulous about movie choices, I wasn't particularly inclined to watch movies that didn't align with my personal taste. The system did not manage to positively surprise me much, as the majority of the recommendations did not resonate with my preferences. While I did find a couple of good movies, the overall experience did not significantly exceed my expectations or introduce me to new genres or styles that I would consider watching.
