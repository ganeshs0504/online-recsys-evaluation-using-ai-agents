        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Dracula (1958), Higher Learning (1995), Sabrina (1954), Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995), Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000), among them, I watched ['Dracula (1958)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 3

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be spot-on. While I did enjoy "Dracula (1958)" and rated it a 4, the rest of the recommendations were quite off the mark for my tastes. "Sabrina (1954)," "Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995)," and "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)" didn't appeal to me at all. Given my niche preferences and the fact that I only liked one out of five recommendations, I found the system to be largely unsatisfactory.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 2

**REASON:** The recommender system didn't really surprise me in a positive way. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies based solely on my own taste, and the recommendations didn't align well with my preferences. While "Dracula (1958)" was a good pick, the rest were far from what I usually enjoy. The system didn't introduce me to any new genres or films that piqued my interest outside of my usual preferences. Therefore, it didn't offer much in terms of positive surprises.
