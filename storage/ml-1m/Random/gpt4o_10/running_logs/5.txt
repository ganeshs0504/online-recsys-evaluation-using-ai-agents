        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Color Me Blood Red, Living Out Loud, Walking Dead, The, Outsiders, The, Carriers Are Waiting, The, among them, I watched ['Color Me Blood Red'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

**Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.**

**RATING:** 4

**REASON:** As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I am very selective about the movies I choose to watch. The recommender system did manage to suggest "Color Me Blood Red," which I enjoyed and rated a 4. However, the rest of the recommendations, such as "Living Out Loud," did not align with my very specific tastes. Given my discerning nature, the system's inability to consistently recommend movies that match my preferences left me somewhat unsatisfied. Therefore, I decided to leave the system after browsing just one page.

**Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.**

**RATING:** 3

**REASON:** The recommender system did not particularly surprise me in a positive way. While it did suggest one movie that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my highly selective and specific tastes. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I am not easily swayed by movies that fall outside my preferred genres and themes. The system's overall quality did not impress me enough to consider watching movies that did not align with my personal taste.
