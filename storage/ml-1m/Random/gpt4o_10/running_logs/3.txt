        Relevant context from user 3's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Open Your Eyes (Abre los ojos), Three Days of the Condor, Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme), Maximum Risk, Big Green, The, among them, I watched ['Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Three Days of the Condor', 'Maximum Risk', 'Big Green, The'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]

THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
- RATING: 3
- REASON: As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be spot-on. Out of the six movies recommended, I only found one ('Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme)') that I enjoyed and rated a 4. The rest did not align with my tastes at all, which led me to leave the system after just one page. The system didn't cater well to my niche preferences in horror, romantic comedies, classics, adventure, and fantasy.

Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positively surprise you? This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didn't align with the personal taste. The motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself.
- RATING: 2
- REASON: The system didn't really surprise me positively. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies based on my own taste, and the recommendations mostly missed the mark. While 'Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme)' was a pleasant find, the rest of the recommendations did not pique my interest or align with my niche preferences. Therefore, the system did not motivate me to explore movies outside my usual tastes.
