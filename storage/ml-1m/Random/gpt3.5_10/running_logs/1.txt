Q1: RATING: 6; REASON: I feel somewhat satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, there were still a few misses in terms of aligning with my taste. I appreciate the effort, but there is room for improvement.

Q2: RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system didn't positively surprise me much. I am quite selective with my movie choices, and the recommendations that didn't align with my taste didn't really spark my interest. I prefer to stick to movies that I know I will enjoy rather than taking a chance on something different.
