        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Village of the Damned (1995), Gnome-Mobile, The (1967), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), Loser (2000), Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1997), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The movies recommended to me did not align with my taste for action-packed, comedy, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop, and sports dramas. I found the selection to be quite disappointing, and it did not capture my interest enough to continue exploring further.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. The recommended movies were so far from my preferred genres that I had no motivation to watch them. The lack of alignment with my taste made it difficult for me to consider any of the recommendations, leading to a low score in terms of positive surprise.
