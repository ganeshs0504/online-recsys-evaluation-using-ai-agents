        Relevant context from user 2's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Land Girls, The (1998), Jackal, The (1997), Cutthroat Island (1995), Agnes Browne (1999), Time Bandits (1981), among them, I watched ['Jackal, The (1997)', 'Time Bandits (1981)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Land Girls, The (1998)', 'Cutthroat Island (1995)', 'Agnes Browne (1999)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 2, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 6; REASON: I feel somewhat satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, such as "Jackal, The (1997)" and "Time Bandits (1981)," there were still a few movies that didn't align with my taste at all. I appreciate the effort in providing diverse recommendations, but there is room for improvement in better understanding my preferences.

Q2: RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did surprise me slightly with its movie choices, especially with "Time Bandits (1981)" which I wouldn't have picked myself. However, the overall surprise factor wasn't significant enough to make me consider watching more movies from the recommendations.
