        Relevant context from user 3's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Open Your Eyes (Abre los ojos) (1997), Three Days of the Condor (1975), Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme) (1966), Maximum Risk (1996), Big Green, The (1995), among them, I watched ['Man and a Woman, A (Un Homme et une Femme) (1966)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Open Your Eyes (Abre los ojos) (1997)', 'Three Days of the Condor (1975)', 'Maximum Risk (1996)', 'Big Green, The (1995)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 3, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While I did find one movie that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my tastes at all. I was hoping for more accurate suggestions based on my preferences.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. The recommended movies were quite far from my usual genres, and I did not feel motivated to watch them despite their quality. I prefer sticking to movies that align more closely with my preferred genres.
