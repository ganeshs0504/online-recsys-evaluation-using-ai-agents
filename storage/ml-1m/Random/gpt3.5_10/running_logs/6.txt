        Relevant context from user 6's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Washington Square (1997), Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000), Bad Boys (1995), Moonraker (1979), Home Fries (1998), among them, I watched ['Washington Square (1997)', 'Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)', 'Bad Boys (1995)', 'Moonraker (1979)', 'Home Fries (1998)'] and rate them ['2', '1', '2', '1', '2'] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 6, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The movies recommended to me did not align with my tastes at all, and I ended up disliking most of them. I prefer movies that are thrilling, emotionally charged, thought-provoking, and visually captivating, which were not reflected in the recommendations I received.

Q2: RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me much. While I appreciate the effort to introduce me to new movies, the choices presented to me were too far from my usual preferences. I am open to exploring diverse and unique films, but the recommendations did not resonate with me in terms of quality or appeal.
