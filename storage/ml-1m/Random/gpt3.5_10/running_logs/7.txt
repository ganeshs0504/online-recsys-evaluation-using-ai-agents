        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Little Mermaid, The (1989), Independence Day (ID4) (1996), Dumb & Dumber (1994), Yojimbo (1961), Three Days of the Condor (1975), among them, I watched ['Yojimbo (1961)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Little Mermaid, The (1989)', 'Independence Day (ID4) (1996)', 'Dumb & Dumber (1994)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 4; REASON: I appreciate the effort put into recommending movies that align with my taste, but the majority of the suggestions were not to my liking. I did find one movie that I enjoyed, but overall, I left feeling unsatisfied due to the lack of options that truly resonated with me.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. While I did find one movie that I enjoyed, the other recommendations were far from what I typically look for in a film. The system failed to capture the essence of my highly selective movie taste, leading to a lack of motivation to explore further recommendations.
