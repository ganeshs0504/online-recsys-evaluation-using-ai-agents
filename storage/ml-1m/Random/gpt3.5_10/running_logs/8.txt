        Relevant context from user 8's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Wild Wild West (1999), Open Your Eyes (Abre los ojos) (1997), Peacemaker, The (1997), Prophecy, The (1995), Affair of Love, An (Une Liaison Pornographique) (1999), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Wild Wild West (1999)', 'Peacemaker, The (1997)', 'Prophecy, The (1995)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 8, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Answer the following questions in the format of - RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation for the rating]
Q1: Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate it from 1 - 10 and give explanation.
Q2: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did the recommender system positvly surprise you. This metric calculates how inclined are you to watch the recommended movie even though it didnt align with the personal taste. THe motivation can be from the overall quality of the recommender system or the movie choice in itself
        

Q1: RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The movies recommended to me did not align with my taste at all, and I ended up disliking most of them. The system failed to understand my preferences for dramatic and emotional storylines, thought-provoking films, and a mix of humor and romance.

Q2: RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not positively surprise me at all. The movie choices presented to me were so far from what I enjoy in films that I had no motivation to watch any of them. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I prioritize quality and alignment with my preferences, which this system did not deliver.
